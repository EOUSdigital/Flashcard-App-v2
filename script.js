//TODO 📕 Module 06 - Loops, Iteration and High Order Array Methods - Lesson 03.05: Break and Continue - Flashcard App v2


//TODO 📝 Flashcard App v2

//  Build on your original Flashcard App by adding smarter loop logic using:
//  • continue to skip irrelevant cards
//  • break to stop once a milestone is hit

//* ✅ Feature Enhancements
//  Here are two enhancements to guide your development:

//?  Feature 1: Skip Skipped Cards (Use continue)
//  Some flashcards may be marked as:

```js
status: "skipped"
```
//  ✅ If a card has this status, skip it — don’t display it or log anything.

//? 🔹 Feature 2: Stop at Mastery (Use break)
//  As before, if any card has:

```js
status: "mastered"
```

//  ✅ Immediately stop the loop and log a message like:
//  • "Mastery reached! Ending review."

//* 🧠 Pseudocode Prompt
//  Loop through the flashcards array.
//  • Skip any card with status "skipped".
//  • Stop the loop entirely when the first card with status "mastered" is reached.
//  • Otherwise, print the question.
//  ✍️ Please write your pseudocode first, and I’ll review it before we implement the solution.


//? ☑️ Pseudocode

// SET flashcards TO an array of 10 cards
// Each card has a question and a status (e.g., "learning", "skipped", or "mastered")

// FOR let i = 0; i < flashcards.length; i++
//     SET card TO flashcards[i]

//     IF card.status === "skipped"
//         CONTINUE

//     IF card.status === "mastered"
//         PRINT "A mastered card has been found."
//         BREAK

//     ELSE
//         PRINT card.question

//  ✅ This structure shows:
//  ☑️ Precise filtering logic (continue)
//  ☑️ Early exit for a specific condition (break)
//  ☑️ Intentional use of else only when needed

//  🔄 Real-world Parallel:
//  This logic mirrors the experience of using review apps like `Anki`, `Quizlet`, or language trainers, where:
//  • Skipped cards are hidden.
//  • Mastered cards end a review session.

//! 🧮 Solution

const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the largest planet in our solar system?", answer: "Jupiter", status: "learning" },
    { question: "Which element has the atomic number 1?", answer: "Hydrogen", status: "learning" },
    { question: "Which country is known as the Land of the Rising Sun?", answer: "Japan", status: "learning" },
    { question: "Who discovered penicillin?", answer: "Alexander Fleming", status: "skipped" },
    { question: "How many bones are in the adult human body?", answer: "206", status: "learning" },
    { question: "What is the freezing point of water in degrees Celsius?", answer: "0 degrees Celsius", status: "learning" },
    { question: "How many sides does a hexagon have?", answer: "Six", status: "learning" },
    { question: "What is the tallest mountain in the world?", answer: "Mount Everest", status: "skipped" },
    { question: "What is the smallest prime number?", answer: "2", status: "mastered" },
    { question: "What is the hardest natural substance on Earth?", answer: "Diamond", status: "learning" },
];

for (let i = 0; i < flashcards.length; i++) {
    const card = flashcards[i];

    if (card.status === "skipped") {
        continue;
    } else if (card.status === "mastered") {
        console.log("A mastered card has been discovered.");
        break;
    } else {
        console.log(card.question);
    }
}

//* 🔍 What You Did Right:

//  ☑️ 1. Skipped Cards with continue
//  ✅ This filters out skipped cards without printing or processing them — just like in real flashcard apps.

//  ☑️ 2. Stopped on Mastery with break
//  ✅ This ends the session the moment mastery is achieved — simulating a goal met or a checkpoint hit.

//  ☑️ 3. Printed Learning Cards Only
//  ✅ Keeps the user focused on only active review content.

//  🧠 It correctly:
//  • Skips skipped cards
//  • Stops on "mastered"
//  • Displays only learning questions
